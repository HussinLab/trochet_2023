In this paper, we compare three PRS models that incorporate a large
number of genetic markers, we investigated the differences in risk
stratification, and tested how missing genetic data affected risk
stratification through simulation. We show that missing data impact
classification for extreme individuals for high- and low-risk, and
quantiles of risk are sensitive to individual-level genotypemissingness.
